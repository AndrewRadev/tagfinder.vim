INSTALLATION                                          *tagfinder-installation*

There are several ways to install the plugin. The recommended one is by using
Tim Pope's pathogen (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332). In
that case, you can clone the plugin's git repository like so:
>
    git clone git://github.com/AndrewRadev/tagfinder.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/tagfinder
<
If your vim configuration is under git version control, you could also set up
the repository as a submodule, which would allow you to update more easily.
The command is (provided you're in ~/.vim):
>
    git submodule add git://github.com/AndrewRadev/tagfinder.vim.git bundle/tagfinder
<
Another way is to simply copy all the essential directories inside the ~.vim/
directory: autoload, plugin, autoload, doc.

After the plugin is installed, you can use |DefineGlobalTagFinder| to define
global tag-searching commands, or |DefineTagFinder| to define buffer-local
ones. See |tagfinder-usage| section for more details.

Note that the plugin does not add any tagfinders by default. It simply
provides the command to create them in a simple way.

USAGE                                                        *tagfinder-usage*

The plugin's purpose is to simplify searching for tags by their kind. Pressing
<C-]> on a word is easy enough, but occasionally, it's necessary to look for
tags that are not in the immediate vicinity. In such cases, a specific
language token is often needed -- a class, function, module.

The plugin defines a command, |DefineGlobalTagFinder| that lets you create a
command that does just that. The syntax is:
>
    DefineGlobalTagFinder FindFunction f,function
<
This will define the command "FindFunction", which will look for tags with the
kind "f" or the kind "function". The name can be anything you like. The
command will have tab-completion, which means you can type in the first few
characters of the token you're looking for and let vim suggest the rest.
